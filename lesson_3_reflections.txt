When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working with other people or when I need a backup in other servers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I may not want to publish some commits until a certain task is done. Before that, I would like to keep the recent commits unseen.
