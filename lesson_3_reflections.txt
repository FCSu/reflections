When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working with other people or when I need a backup in other servers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I may not want to publish some commits until a certain task is done. Before that, I would like to keep the recent commits unseen.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are the action to clone someone's repository and make a version of your own on GitHub. Clones are the action to make another copy of git repository. Branches are different 'paths' in a single repository. On Github, use forks to describe different repositories. Use clones to describe diffent copies of repositories. Use branches to describe different versions in a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	To reduce the chance of conflicts. Less conflicts means less merges.
